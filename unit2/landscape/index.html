        Use this page to complete the "Generative Landscape" project:
        https://canvas.umw.edu/courses/1499064/assignments/11895985

        the main goal of this program was to create a generative landscape/terrain that you are able to determine what the topography of the map looks like, using perlin noise.
        I chose to do this because I have been learning game development by myself and was wondering how procedural generatoion worked with maps and things like that. So i looked up a bunch of videos about it and wanted to make something similar in p5.js myself testing what i learned from those videos.
